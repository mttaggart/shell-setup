# Shell Setup

This is where I keep my configs for all the custom terminal stuff I do. Included are configurations for:

- Fish
- Terminator
- Alacritty
- Tmux
- Vim
- Neovim

You, dear reader, are welcome to take these configs and use/modify them as you see fit, but pull requests are **not open**. This is my jawn, and I will change it as I see fit.

My [Neovim config](https://github.com/mttaggart/neovim-config) is also available.

Colors are from the [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com), of course.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mttaggart/shell-setup
cd shell-setup
./setup.sh
```
